CA5 involves modifying your calculator class from CA1 to ensure that it can handle lists of data.
You will be required to refactor / rewrite your functions so that they can handle lists.
You will need to use lambda, map, filter, reduce, generator, and list comprehension in any manner you deem necessary to achieve this.
Submit a Python script of your program to moodle and github as well as any tests you have done which should still work.

The deadline is the 18th November 2018 on moodle @ 23:55.
